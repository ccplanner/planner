This is the planner for Chip's Challange

This requires the tworld_py interface and should be updated with it.  Also,
as a part of that we need data, sets, and res directories from the tile world
source code, or from the levelsets repository.

set that up with (or similar)
$ ln -s ../levelsets/data .
$ ln -s ../levelsets/sets .
$ ln -s ../tworld_py/res .

then run with:
$ python run_agent.py

at this point you still have to provide the first move your self, but after that
the planner is called every turn.

Right now it is mostlly pddl files which can be solve with fast downward

Example usage

python pddlgen.py > cc_hazard.pddl

cd <fast downard>/src
translate/translate.py ~/src/chips/planner/pddl/cc_hazard.pddl 
preprocess/preprocess < output.sas 
search/downward --search "astar(blind())" < output
